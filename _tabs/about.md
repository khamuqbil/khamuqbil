## About Me

I am a **SITA Field Engineer** based at **Al Jouf Airport**, where I play a pivotal role in ensuring the seamless operation of IT systems that are critical to the airport's daily functionality. My responsibilities cover a wide range of technical and project management tasks, including system installations, upgrades, troubleshooting, and continuous improvements to the infrastructure.

### Key Projects and Responsibilities:

- **Workstation Deployment & Configuration:** Installed and configured new workstations to support both airport staff and operations, resulting in enhanced performance and increased reliability of the IT systems.

- **Infrastructure Enhancements:** Worked on upgrading essential network components, including server switches, routers, and connectivity systems, which greatly improved communication, data transfer, and operational efficiency across the airport.

- **Airport Management System (AMS):** Involved in the installation and configuration of the **AMS**, ensuring the system integrates seamlessly with existing processes to streamline airport management functions.

- **Flight Information Display System (FIDS):** Played a key role in installing and configuring the **FIDS**, enhancing the way passengers receive real-time flight information, making the travel experience smoother and more efficient.

- **Proactive System Maintenance:** Regularly monitor, troubleshoot, and maintain IT systems to prevent downtime and ensure high levels of operational efficiency. This proactive approach keeps critical airport systems running without interruption.

- **Technical Support & Troubleshooting:** Provide both on-site and remote technical support for a variety of IT systems, from passenger processing tools to backend infrastructure, ensuring immediate resolution of any issues that arise.

### Personal Projects

- **www.jouf.app:** As a personal project, I developed and launched [www.jouf.app](www.jouf.app), a platform created freely for my community in Al Jouf. This project helps residents and airport staff stay updated on flight schedules and provides helpful information about travel and aviation. The success of this project has encouraged me to explore further opportunities in IT and community-based initiatives.

My role as a **Field Engineer** requires the ability to work in fast-paced, high-pressure environments, handling multiple projects simultaneously while maintaining a focus on modernizing and improving the airportâ€™s IT infrastructure. I am committed to driving innovation and efficiency within the aviation industry and contributing to my local community through technology.
